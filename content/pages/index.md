Title: Welcome!

Welcome to my digital storytelling portfolio -- I'm Jack, an independent contractor @ [Aloft Sensing](https://www.aloftsensing.com/) fascinated with synthetic aperture radar and natural hazards. I recently exited a PhD program early at the [University of Washington](https://uw-cryo.github.io/) where my research focused on the application of spaceborne and aerial remote sensing altimetry to measure a wide variety of earth science phenomena (cryosphere, vegetation, solid earth) in precise geodetic frameworks, though I love exploring disclipines from biodiversity conservation to astronomy as well.

Here you can find a collection of my work as it relates to my digital storytelling, including writings, maps, web-based applications, and more. If you're looking for anything in particular, feel free to reach out!
