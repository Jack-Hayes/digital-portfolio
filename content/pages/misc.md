Not everything I work on fits neatly into the digital storytelling world. Sometimes the story lives in a software tool that solves a particular problem, or in a presentation where you're reading the room instead of designing for a screen. This is where I've collected the projects that live outside the purely digital storytelling realm but still capture that same drive to make complex ideas accessible and engaging.

## **Software**

Most of my days are spent deep in code, building tools that bridge the messy reality of academic R&D with the polished expectations of industry delivery. I'm also a huge believer in open-source scientific programming.

### *NASA Surface, Terrain, and Vegetation (STV)*

A large majority of my time at grad school was supporting the STV mission and understanding the bias of different spaceborne altimetry measurements -- you'd be surprised at just how much radar vs lasers vs photogrammetry disagree on tree heights. Below is a Python package built on Pixi and Ruff for grabbing and analyzing these alitmetry measurements from the various disconnected APIs and cloud storage endpoints (prioritizing STAC-compliant data). This feeds into larger NASA efforts with [computer vision approaches for multimodal sensor fusion](https://github.com/uw-cryo/DeepDEM) and [custom lidar processing algorithms](https://github.com/uw-cryo/lidar_tools/tree/main/notebooks).

## **Presentations**

Face-to-face storytelling is truly irreplaceable -- the real-time feedback, the shared energy when an idea finally lands. While this isn't purely digital storytelling, these presentations come alive when paired with the interactive elements you'll find scattered throughout this site. I've had the privilege of speaking with wildly different audiences about various topics I'm excited about, whether that's pitching Microsoft partners on why campus needs more high-performance computing support on campus, sitting on a panel with climate scientists at the American Geophysical Union, or explaining what gravitational waves are to families and how machine learning algorithms help with detecting them.
