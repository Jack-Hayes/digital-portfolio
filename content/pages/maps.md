Title: Maps
Slug: maps

It's weird how I ended up in synthetic aperture radar and scientific programming all because I took an "Introduction to GIS" course in undergrad. I just liked maps.

Most of my mapmaking lately involves products from high-resolution DEMs (a lot of my inspiration comes from the [WA DNR "Bare Earth" hillshades](https://wadnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=36b4887370d141fcbb35392f996c82d9)) trying to capture the topography of different features on Earth. Mostly volcanoes, if I'm being honest. I grew up on ArcPro some years ago, but I've started to realize I can pull off the same things with QGIS and free image editing software. If Gerardus Mercator managed with ink and paper, I figure I can handle it without a bajillion-dollar license.

I wish I had more to share here from my efforts in [conservation planning](https://www.wm.edu/offices/iic/news/iic-conservation-gis-lab-contributes-to-key-biodiversity-area-planning-knowledge.php) and [mapping racial gerrymandering](https://news.wm.edu/2022/10/11/wm-professors-unveil-new-model-to-measure-segregation-in-voting-districts/), but this page is sparse for now.


## **Volcanoes**

### *Universidad de Colima, Colima Intercambio e Investigación en Vulcanología*

In loose collaboration with the Universidad de Colima's [University Center for Volcanological Studies](https://portal.ucol.mx/cueiv/), I develop hazard maps for the estimated effects of the 1913 VEI-4 Sub-Plinian Eruption of Volcán de Colima on modern day infrastructure and population.
