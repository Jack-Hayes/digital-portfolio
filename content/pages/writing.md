There's something deeply satisfying about taking a dense scientific or engineering concept and finding the story buried inside -- the moment when technical jargon transforms into something that actually matters to people. I write because I believe the best science happens when we can share it widely, when the boundaries between expert and curious observer start to blur.


## **Academic Writing**

Boy are academic journals a juxtaposition. After just a year in a PhD program, I've seen enough of the "publish or perish" culture's fascinating contradictions baked into the whole enterprise. There are some interesting dynamics and hypocrisies in this world of science, but I'll leave it at that for now. That said, the core concept of journal papers and articles (scientists openly sharing their results and process with the broader scientific community) is a positive.

### *Community-Based Water Resource Management*

Here, I reflect on my time in undergrad conducting community-based water resource management research in Nepal in a short blog style.

### *Technical Concepts*

Below is an example of a web-hosted, user-interactive jupyter notebooks and markdown files which holds a special place in my heart in the scientific programming realm.
