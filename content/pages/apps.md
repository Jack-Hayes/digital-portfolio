Title: Apps
Slug: apps

I'm no app developer by trade, but I've stumbled into building some pretty cool ones along the way. There's this magic in interactive web elements that makes even the densest stories suddenly click, like handing someone the keys to explore rather than just telling them where to go.

### *Astronomy*

I helped create a web app on the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse during my time with Harvard's Center for Astrophysics which proved to be incredibly helpful to both myself and friends for the event. Made me feel bad for the west coast, though.

## **Business**

### *Tourism*

In undergrad, I briefly helped develop an app for tourists who visit Williamsburg, VA--a charge led by the First Gentlemen of the college and some great graduate students. The project is still going strong at William & Mary by some talented students bolstered by the campus Entrepreneurship Hub.
